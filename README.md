# Counselor_CaseLogHelper
This website allows you to login as an employee, then to add case logs for student affairs as if you were a counselor.


Please see the .mdf database file included in the project. I see now the site is lacking a CreateEmployee page, as my 
original intent was to emulate an existing database project. If moved to the C:\Users\owner folder, the db should be found by Visual Studio.
